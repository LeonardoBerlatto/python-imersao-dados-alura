# :bar_chart: python-imersao-dados-alura

Project used to store all the content and knowledge I got from [Alura's Imersão Dados](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-dados).

## :book: About

This projet contains charts and simple machine learning models built using ENEM 2019 data. You can find the same data [here](http://inep.gov.br/web/guest/microdados)

The graphs provide some insights of relationships like, for example, between household income and test scores.

The machine learning models try to predict a continuous variable by a serie of other continuous variables

## ▶ Running the project 
You can open all the **.ipynb* files on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to have a full operating system with no effort

*Or...*

You can run locally
```bash
python -m venv venv
source /venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
